    "The work this week has involved using Pandas to load, manipulate, and visualize data.  For this exercise, we're going to be working with some of the price transparency data from [Baptist Health Medical Center](https://www.baptist-health.com/hospital-charges-and-negotiated-rates/) in Little Rock, AR. We've chosen them because their data is relatively easy to reach with Pandas and has some interesting insights.\n",
